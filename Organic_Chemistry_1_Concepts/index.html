        <h3>Valence Shell, Bonding Influence, and Formal Charges</h3>
            <p>
            Looking at the periodic table, it may seem as though the position of each atom is "randomly" assorted based on some arbitary criteria.
            This though, is incorrect, as the elements on the periodic table are assorted based on their atomic number and the corresponding amount of electrons
            each have in their "orbitals".
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Take hydrogen for example, based on the atomic number we can deduce that a "H" atom has 1 proton, 1 electron, and 1 neutron. We know that atoms have nuclei
            which contain the neutrons and protons of the atom and act as the main "body" of the element. We also learn that electrons revolve around the nucleus of an atom
            as protons being positively charged, attract the negatively charged electrons. The question then becomes, where are the electrons "exactly"?
            While no electron follows a set path around an atom, we refer to known paths as electron density domains, meaning the area an electron is most likely to be found,
            which is typically along some circular path.
            </p>

            Through experimentation methods such as crystallography, researchers were able to determine ranges at which electrons generally travel around a nucleus, which have 
            adopted the letters "s", "p", "d", and "f". The orbitals which electrons shuttle into go in this specific order, with the super script on each orbital corresponding
            to the number of electrons the orbital can hold.

            Returning to the hydrogen atom, we can see that since it only has one electron, it will exist in the 1s orbital. Since this is hydrogens only and highest order shell, we refer to it as 
            its "valence" shell, representing the electrons that will actively interact with species apart from the original atom. All atoms wish to fill or lose their valence shell, as it will give them an electron 
            number comparable to the Noble Gas closest to the specified atom, in this case it would be Helium for Hydrogen, making the atom highly stable and unreactive. This is the reason that hydrogen only has
            1 potential bonding pair between another atom, as an additional bond would create room for a 2s orbital which is energetically unfavored.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Given this, we can apply the same concept to most other atoms in the periodic table, most notably carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) as these are the most common atoms seen within Organic Chemistry.
            Carbon's spot on the periodic table demonstrates 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals, this final "p" orbital being unfilled and only containing 2 electrons. Given concepts previously discussed, to fill this new valence shell, carbon would
            need 4 more electrons to fill this shell to mimic Neon. To accomplish this, carbon can bond to 4 other atoms and "covalently" share 4 electrons to reach this state. Doing this for oxygen and nitrogen, we can see that 
            oxygen wants to have 2 bonds, and nitrogen with 3. 
            </p>
            <h4>Octet Rule</h4>
            <p>
            You may also notice within some depictions of organic compounds, that oxgyen and nitrogen typically have extra electrons along with their bonding. We know why they have the bonds, but why is it necessary to include these 
            "lone pairs"? The reason is known as the Octet Rule, which explains the trend seen on the periodic table. Taking oxygen as an example, we can see in the "2" valence shell that there are 6 electrons in the atoms neutral state,
            2 in the 2s orbital and 4 in the 2p orbital. As we discussed before, oxygen likes to have 2 bonds in order to gain <strong>access</strong> to the 2 electrons it is naturally missing in order to reach a comparable state to Neon.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            It also is important to mention the way electrons work within bonds, as when two atoms bond, each share 1 electron each in some capacity, meaning that in a bond we can consider each atom as having "ownership" of 1 of the electrons, but having
            "access" to 2 as each atom has connection to each other's shared electron.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Given a oxygen structure below, we can see that the 2 bonds between it and the carbon atoms signify 2 electrons each. This means that there are only 4 electrons that the oxygen atom has <strong>access</strong> to, meaning 4 more electrons signified through lone pairs,
            need to be added to the oxygen atom to give the oxygen atom the full 8 valence electrons. However, there is no charge applied to the oxygen atom, because the oxygen only <strong>owns</strong> 6 electrons, 4 from the lone pairs, and 1 from each bond.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
            Now we must ask, what happens when an atom goes over the amount of electrons it "owns"? Take the structure below which features the methanoate anion. We can apply a -1 charge to the oxygen because there are 6 lone pair electrons
            and 1 electron in the bond between it and the carbon. Given that a neutral oxygen atom only has 6 valence electrons in its "ownership", the extra electron gives the oxygen a -1 "formal charge" as there is now a -1 charge 
            in comparison to its neutral state.
            </p>

        <h3>Skeleton, Lewis, and Condensed Structures</h3>
            <p>
            You may also notice in organic chemistry that there are multiple ways a compound or molecule can be written. Below are the most common examples of each case with their names which can be used as reference when detailing them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            The Condensed Structure is arguably the most common in literature, as it allows someone to express a given compound without writing out its full structure. We also have the ability to count the number and types of atoms the fastest in this
            expression of a compound in comparison to others.
            </p>
            <img src="images/condensed_skeletal_lewis.jpg" alt="Representation of a condensed, skeletal, and lewis structure" height="500" length="500">
            <br>
            <p>
            The Skeletal Structure is the most common interpretation within organic chemistry, as it is often the quickest to write out and allows for better visualization of atomic bonding as it can include <strong>stereochemistry</strong>, a topic discussed
            later. You may notice that there aren't any carbon or hydrogen atoms explicity drawn out. You don't need to in a structure like this because each "node" is acting as a carbon, and based on the number of bonds the node visually has, corresponds to the number of hydrogen.
            Take the carbon node furtherest to the left, there is only one bond stretching from this carbon towards another node. We understand that carbon likes to have 4 bonds, and since it only has 1 explicity drawn, we can infer that the node on the left, or this carbon atom
            has 3 hydrogen atoms connected to it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Finally, the Lewis Structure is the best visual for writing lone pairs and bond interactions. It essentially acts as a more completed version of the Skeletal Structure, as it actually includes the carbons and hydrogens.
