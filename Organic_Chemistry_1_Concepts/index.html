            Looking at the periodic table, it may seem as though the position of each atom is "randomly" assorted based on some arbitary criteria.
            This though, is incorrect, as the elements on the periodic table are assorted based on their atomic number and the corresponding amount of electrons
            each have in their "orbitals".

            Take hydrogen for example, based on the atomic number we can deduce that a "H" atom has 1 proton, 1 electron, and 1 neutron. We know that atoms have nuclei
            which contain the neutrons and protons of the atom and act as the main "body" of the element. We also learn that electrons revolve around the nucleus of an atom
            as protons being positively charged, attract the negatively charged electrons. The question then becomes, where are the electrons "exactly"?
            While no electron follows a set path around an atom, we refer to known paths as electron density domains, meaning the area an electron is most likely to be found,
            which is typically along some circular path.

            Through experimentation methods such as crystallography, researchers were able to determine ranges at which electrons generally travel around a nucleus, which have 
            adopted the letters "s", "p", "d", and "f". The orbitals which electrons shuttle into go in this specific order, with the super script on each orbital corresponding
            to the number of electrons the orbital can hold.

            Returning to the hydrogen atom, we can see that since it only has one electron, it will exist in the 1s orbital. Since this is hydrogens only and highest order shell, we refer to it as 
            its "valence" shell, representing the electrons that will actively interact with species apart from the original atom. All atoms wish to fill their valence shell, as it will give them an electron 
            number comparable to the Noble Gas closest to the specified atom, in this case it would be Helium for Hydrogen, making the atom highly stable and unreactive.
