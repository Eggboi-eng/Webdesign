      <h3>Question 1</h3>
        <p>
            The main trick in the problem is to recongize the number of 
            hydrogens on each carbon. Given that carbon in nearly all 
            practical cases of organic chemistry only contains 4 bonds to abide 
            by the Octet rule, you can assume the bonds associated to a unique 
            atom by how many hydrogens appear attached to a specific carbon.
