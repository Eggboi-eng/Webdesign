        <p><em>To note is that a hydronium (a water molecule with an additional proton) is regenerated. This isn't considered a catalyst however as a water molecule is consumed to create the alcohol.</em>

        <p><em>The "X" represents a halogen such as Br, Cl, or I. "hv" refers to light, which is typically interpreted as UV radiation. The lone electron selects for the more substituted carbon due to higher stability, thus forcing the "X" group to attach to the less substituted carbon.</em>

            <li>Anti-Markovnikov</li>
            <li>Syn + Anti</li>

        <img src="images/oxymercuration-deoxymercuration.jpg" alt="" length="" height="">
        <p><em>To note is that due to the creation of a mercury ion bridge, there can be no regarrangement in a proton or methyl shift. The δ sign indicates relative electron density in a molecule, such as in this case where hydrogens retain the electrons for a larger amount of time than the boron. For most courses, this mechanism is not pertinent.</em></p>
